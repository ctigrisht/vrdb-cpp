# WELCOME TO VRDB
## Vector Relational Database

### WHAT IS VRDB?

VRDB is a lightweight noSQL relational database server with graph capabilities and fixed schemas.
It is intended to be used on small scale systems that require a network accessible database.

### WHY VRDB?

People don't like noSQL because there is no schema or relationships, people don't like SQL because, you know, SQL...
So then, why not just use a noSQL database with a schema and advanced relationships? Sounds perfect right?

Then, there is also the common concensus that using a full-fledged heavy database server on light hardware for small scale operations is too much.
People creating small scale projects will tend to use a monolith with a local file database, such as SQLite.
Why not have a lightweight database server that can share requests across the network, thus enabling shared state across services.
